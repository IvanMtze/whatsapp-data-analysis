This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook.


Load library rwhatsapp
```{r}
library("rwhatsapp")
```

We just need to import our chat (s) to make an analysis.

```{r}
chat <- rwa_read("Chat.txt")
```

This result on a data.frame with the information of chat(s).

On this example, I made an analysis on a friend chat. For example: I want to know how many messages he send on a day.
```{r}
library("ggplot2"); theme_set(theme_minimal())
library("lubridate")
chat %>%
  mutate(day = date(time)) %>%
  count(day) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = day, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  ylab("") + xlab("") +
  ggtitle("Messages per day")
```
